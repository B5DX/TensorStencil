# TensorStencil

This repository contains the executable files for implementing the algorithm described in the paper "TensorStencil: Achieving Practical Tensorization on Stencil Using Versatile Tensor Core Units."

All executable files are located in the 'exe' folder. The file names follow the format of "kernel_name.T_num". The files with the prefix "no_sm_" are executable files used for comparing the performance impact of using shared memory on algorithm in the experimental section of the paper.
